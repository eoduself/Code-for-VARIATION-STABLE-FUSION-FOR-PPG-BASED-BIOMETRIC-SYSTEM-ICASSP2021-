# Thank you for considering a Code for this paper[1] 

Here, we introduce the implementation of the proposed model and fusion methods with variation-stable.

Please download the ipynb to see the sample results. If you want to access the Example_database.mat, please email to daeyon.hwang@mail.utoronto.ca.

For reference, Example_database.mat comes from PRRB [2].

To investigate the result of different true user ID, search the 'Set Target Subject' and change the variable ‘ID’ to a different value ranging from 1 to 42. 

The data (Example_database.mat) and the code (ICASSP_2021_Code.ipynb) should be placed in the same directory. 


Thank you!

Dae Yon Hwang
