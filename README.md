# Thank you for considering a Code for this paper[1] 

Here, we introduce the implementation of the proposed model and fusion methods with variation-stable.

Please download the ipynb and sample example dataset to run the code. Sample example dataset comes from PRRB [2].

Yet, sample result is included in ipynb where you can observe the outputs of this stage. 

To investigate the result of different true user ID, search the 'Set Target Subject' and change the variable ‘ID’ to a different value ranging from 1 to 42. 

The data (Example_database.mat) and the code (ICASSP_2021_Code.ipynb) should be placed in the same directory. 


Thank you!
